# AI-system

AI-System is a lightweight neural network trained on the Kaggle Cracked/Non-Cracked surface image dataset. The current version is implemented in pure Python using NumPy and OpenCV, and achieves up to 70% accuracy on the validation set.

This project is a proof of concept for an embedded, vision-based crack detection system that will eventually be ported to C/C++ for deployment on microcontrollers.
